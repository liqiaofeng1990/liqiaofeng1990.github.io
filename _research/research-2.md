title: "Marine energy conversion"
excerpt: "The ocean possesses enormous sustainable and renewable energy in the form of wave, current, salinity difference, and temperature difference. We exploit this energy fountain, by designing multi-scale machinery to convert the largely untapped wave and hydrokinetic energy. We solve the challenges from 3 perspectives: hydrodynamics, power take-off, and control.<br/><img src='/images/researchthemes_marineenergyconverter_overall.png'>"

The US department of energy (DOE) has identified 3 thrust research areas to advance the technology and commericial maturation of the marine energy conversion industry:
1. hydrodynamics
2. power take-off (PTO)
3. control
