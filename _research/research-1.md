title: "Force identification"
excerpt: "Force identification is an inverse technique to localize and reconstruct external forces on structures based on the structure reponses. In engineering practice, when directly measuring the external forces is physically or economically infeasible, we resort to force identification techniques. Potential applications include machine tool force prediction, vehicle weigh-in-motion systems, and structural health monitoring.<br/><img src='/images/researchthemes_forceidentification_overall.png'>"

Three critical concepts exist in structural dynamics:
1. Input forces;
2. Structure or system;
3. Output responses.

The forward problem is defined as calculating the output of a certain structure if information on input forces and structure properties is given. Identification of system parameters or model based on known input and output is called type-I inverse problem. Identification of input forces based on known system model and measured output is type-II inverse problem, the focus of this article and the theme of my Ph.D. reserach.
