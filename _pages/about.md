I currently work as a postdoctoral associate in the <a href="http://seb199.me.vt.edu/zuo/" target="_blank">Energy Harvesting and Mechatronics Research Laboratory</a> in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Virginia Tech, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.me.vt.edu/people/faculty/lei-zuo/" target="_blank">Prof. Lei Zuo</a>. Energy Harvesting and Mechatronics Research Laboratory is part of the Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems (CEHMS), which is sponsored through the National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) program as the sole center in US dedicated to energy harvesting technologies. Prof. Zuo is the director of this center.

My current research at the center involves design and development of large-scale ocean and wind energy conversion technologies. Our recent focuses are (1) creative design of new mechanism for ocean and wind energy technologies; (2) hydrodynamic and aeroelastic optimization of different devices; (3) design, control, and prototyping of advanced power take-off systems.
